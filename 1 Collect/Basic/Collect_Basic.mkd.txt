## Background

Importing data is the first step in any anlaytics with any software package.  The more powerful products will let you combine various data sources into one project, but you're almost always going to start with gathering your data into one system.  As you get better at doing analytics, importing data will become routine and you'll quickly fly through these steps.  

Quite often spreadsheets have a little or even a lot of formatting around the data.  The trick with importing this is to remove as much of it as possible ahead of time.  The very first row should just be field or column names.  Unmerge any merged cells ahead of time.  

## Problem Statement

Your business partner has provided several spreadsheets of data to analyze.  They're the result of a report and some analytics she performed.  Your manager would like to get the data imported to the tool of choice and ready for quality confirmation checks.  Along with this data, you have two reference spreadsheets that provide location and item specific data.
