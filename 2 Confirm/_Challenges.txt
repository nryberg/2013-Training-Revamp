B) Your business partner has provided two spreadsheets of data to analyze.  They're the result of a report and some analytics she performed.  Your manager would like to get the data imported to the tool of choice and ready for quality confirmation checks.

G) The spreadsheets import without a problem, but now we've got a SAP report in text file format and we would like to import location data from a database.  

M) Our third party vendor has provided a couple of PDF reports - they're great because they can't be changed, but they're terrible because almost no analytic tool easily imports PDF data.
