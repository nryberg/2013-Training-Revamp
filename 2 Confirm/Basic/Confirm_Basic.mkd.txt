## Background

Data quality is a challenge no matter where you work.  How can you do good analytics if you can't make sure the base data is sufficiently accurate?  Where are the sources of problems:  User error, transcription, bad design, uncertain scoping, computer glitches, sabotage (intentional or otherwise)?  It doesn't matter - you need to demonstrate to your manager that your analytics rest on a foundation of thoroughly designed tests.


## Problem Statement


What can you confirm your data against?  System Reports, other's analytics, published numbers, line-by-line testing, business area knowledge.

Row counts, column totals and simple statistics can give you a quick snapshot into the data and provide comfort that you're relying on good data.
