# Kickoff
## Background

We're working with computers, and wherever possible, we should be using automation to simplify and speed up the process of analyzing our data. If there's a task that you have to repeat on a regular basis, there's probably a way to get our programs to run them for ourselves.

This section will just focus on simple repetitive scripts that can be run at any time. 

## Problem Statement

Your business partner loves the summary of sales by state and wants it run every two weeks.  The analytics are simple and straightforward and you've got a direct link to the fresh data.  

Use the scripting abilities of your analytic tool to make it easy to update and share the report results. 

## Objectives

Once you're done with this section, you should be able to refresh data, pull a report and export it to Excel - all at the click of a button. 

# Content

1. Showing Table History
2. Creating a script using the Table History
3. Renaming and commenting the script for ease of reuse.
