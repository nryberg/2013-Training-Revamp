# Kickoff
## Background

On occasion, the data you're getting from your sources is perfectly formatted and ready to be used.  Just as rarely, the data you have is in a  completely different format than what you need.  In most cases, there are just minor tweaks that can make the data more readable and always more testable.

In this section we will focus on the majority of fixes - simple but effective.  

We rely on the fact that most computer systems and analytic tools group data into one of four types - text, number, date and logical true/false.  Take a few minutes to review the data types section of the analytic glossary.  

## Problem Statement

Our data is in the system, we've confirmed that things are pretty accurate, but when we looked at store opening dates, we realized they weren't coming in as dates - they just showed up as plain text.  In another table, we'd like to have comprehensive DPCI codes that are easy to read - just like in the store. 

What can we do to make basic changes to the type and selection of data?

## Objectives

After this section, you will be able to change the format of a field between text and a number, and between text and a date.

# Action

## Activity

1. Create a new text field in the Stores table with a "T-" and the store number
2. Create a field in the sales table that multiplies the RETL_A and WKLY_SLS_Q for a "Total Sales Amount"
3. Create a number field in the location table that calculates the number of days a store has been open. 


## Quiz

1. What is the total value for the "Total Sales Amount" Field?
