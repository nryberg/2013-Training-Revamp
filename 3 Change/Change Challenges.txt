1) Our data is in the system, we've confirmed that things are pretty accurate, but when we looked at store opening dates, we realized they weren't coming in as dates - they just showed up as plain text.  In another table, we'd like to have comprehensive DPCI codes that are easy to read - just like in the store.

What can we do to make basic changes to the type and selection of data?


2) Sometimes good data is buried in a big pile of hay.  How do we uncover those hidden gems by picking out just the right piece of text?

3) As we group and gather our data, it helps to have conditional fields.  These simple test fields deliver data depending on the condition of a different field.  In this case, we want to categorize sales by quantity into four simple levels - None, Low, Medium, High.
