## Background

Sometimes good data is buried in a big pile of hay.  How do we uncover those hidden gems by picking out just the right piece of text?

Great analytic tools provide powerful ways to conditionally select just the right pieces of information from larger fields.  

## Problem Statement

You've been provided a list of item descriptions for fireworks.  Unsurprisingly, the description starts with the word Fireworks.  We already know what we're working with, so we'd like to remove the first word in the description if it's "Fireworks"

## Objectives

After this section, you will be able to do beginning text manipulation with arrays of strings.  This is beginning programming skills!
